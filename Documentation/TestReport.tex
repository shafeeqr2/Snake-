\section{Features that were Tested}

\begin{itemize}
\item 1:The functional requirements of the product
\item 2:The classes and methods of the product (Model)
\item 3:The GUI of the product
\end{itemize}

\section{Testing Types}
Testing can be broken up into different types, which each have their own role in the testing the product. These test types should be utilized to comprehensively evaluate the quality of the product.
\subsection{Structural Testing}
Structural testing  is also known as white box testing. Structural tests are derived from the program's internal structure. It focuses on the nonfunctional requirements of the product. This type of testing shows errors that occur during the implementation by focusing on abnormal and extreme cases the product could encounter.
\subsection{Functional Testing}
Functional testing is also known as black box testing. Functional tests are derived from the functional requirements of the program. It focuses less on how the program works and more on the output of the system. These tests are focused on test cases where the product receives expected information.
\subsection{Static vs. Dynamic Testing}
Static testing simulate the dynamic environment and does not focus on code exectution. This testing involves code walkthroughs and requirements walkthroughs. Static testing is used prevalently in the design stage. In contrast, dynamic testing needs code to be executed. \newline\newline
Dynamic testing involves test cases to be run and checked against expected outcomes. A technique to save time during dynamic testing is to choose representative test cases. 
\subsection{Manual vs. Automatic Testing}
Manual testing is done by people. It involves code walkthroughs and inspection. \newline\newline
Automatic testing can usually be conducted by computers. The tools used to assist with automatic are unit testing tools for the respective programming language. Automatic testing relies on people for testing more qualitative aspects like GUI. 


\section{Automated Unit Testing}
For most of the applicable functions and methods, we tested for robustness by inputting abnormal conditions and extreme domains.

R1: The game must start with a main menu screen with a play game button, quit game button, and three difficulty buttons from 1-3 & Pass  \\ \hline
	R2: When the play game button is pressed, and instruction will appear and wait for
user input.& Pass  \\ \hline
	R3: The snake must be controlled by the keyboard. w, a, s, d or directional keys. & Pass  \\ \hline
	R4: If the snake goes over the same location of a food object, a new food object will
be generated and the snake will grow. & Pass  \\ \hline
	R5: Preceeding the instructions screen, the gameboard will appear with a single snake
and food object. & Pass  \\ \hline
R6: Pressing the esc key during the game brings up a pause screen that displays
resume, main menu and quit game buttons.& Pass  \\ \hline
	R7: As the player advances in the game, the snake moves faster. & Pass \\ \hline
	R8: When the snake hits the border or itself (after power up is used), the game is over. & Pass  \\ \hline
	R9: The game calculates a score that is based on the length of the snake. & Pass  \\ \hline
	R10: The game over screen displays the score and a retry buttons and quit game
button. & Pass  \\ \hline
	R11: The snake will start with a power up that allows the player to collide with the
snake body once without consequence. & Pass  \\ \hline

\section{Summary of Results}
The code of the Snake game has been split up into modules. This allows for unit testing to occur. All the modules were thoroughly tested and checked for robustness.

Usability testing was also carried out by allowing gamers to have a chance to play the game first hand and fill out the a survey about their experience playing the game.

The results of the tests were promising and it can be concluded that the Snake Game is ready to be released.

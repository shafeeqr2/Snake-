This project is a redevelopment of the tradional Snake Game. Original code can be found in file "nibbles.py" by Grant Jenks.

Our modified code can be found in the course folder. Open "Controller.py" to run the game.

This game makes use of the python library "pygame". It can be downloaded from www.pygame.org.

It was a part of our Software Engineering Course titled "Software Engineering Practice and Experience: Software Project Management (SFWR ENG 3XA3)" at McMaster University.

We hope our well documented, commented and modular code can be used as a basic for further redevelopment by other students and programmers alike.

Team Members: Keyur Patel, Shafeeq Rabbani and Alex Guerrero.
